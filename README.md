# WeatherSage: Weather Information Retriever

## Overview
This Python script retrieves current weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It then displays relevant weather statistics including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, it saves the API response content to a file named 'Weather.txt'.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- requests library: Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- datetime module: Used for obtaining the current date and time.

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system and install the requests library if not already installed using the following command:
```shell
pip install requests
```

## Usage

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) by signing up for a free account.
2. Replace `<api-key-here>` in the script with your obtained API key.
3. Run the script and enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve weather information when prompted.

## Code Structure

The script is structured as follows:

- **Import Statements**: Imports necessary modules and libraries including `requests` and `datetime`.
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the name of the city for which they want to retrieve weather information.
- **API Request**: Constructs an API request URL using the user-provided city name and the API key. Sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and obtains weather data in JSON format.
- **Data Processing**: Extracts relevant weather information such as temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed from the API response.
- **Output**: Displays the retrieved weather statistics along with the current date and time.
- **File Writing**: Saves the API response content to a file named 'Weather.txt' in binary mode.

## Error Handling

The script does not include extensive error handling. It assumes valid input from the user and successful API requests. Potential areas for improvement include adding error handling for cases such as invalid city names or failed API requests.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided as a demonstration of accessing weather data from an external API and should be used for educational purposes only. The usage of the OpenWeatherMap API is subject to their terms and conditions.
